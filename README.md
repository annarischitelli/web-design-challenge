Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past assignment. 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which I can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where I can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.

Website Requirements that I implemented:

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:
- A landing page containing:
- An explanation of the project.
- Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
- Four visualization pages, each with:
    - A descriptive title and heading tag.
    - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
    - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
- A "Comparisons" page that:
    - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
    - Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
- A "Data" page that:
    - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    - The table must be a bootstrap table component.
- The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu.

The website is deployed to GitHub pages.
